Machine Learning Algorithims were Used to Predict Player Value in Euros.

# **Machine Learning Process**

Given a Dataset of FIFA Player Attributes (Derived from FIFA 18 Video Game from EA Sports), Player Values were Predicted.

Machine Learning Algorithums of Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression were Used.

Attributes with the Most Impact on Player Value were Ordered by Significance. The Results were:

  Age – Potential – Finishing – Reactions – Dribbling – Ball Control – Long Shots – Volleys – Vision
  
These Attributes were Used to Predict Each Player's Value using a SKLEARN Test/Train Model.

Actual Player Values and Predicted Player Values are Depicted Using Matplotlib.

# **Analysis**


When determining salary for a new player two questions to consider are; How old is the player?, and “How 	does the player rate in ‘Potential’?  

These two factors played the largest role in a player’s value.  	

Based on machine learning algorithms, player age has a 6% importance relevancy rating on the 	player’s value (higher than any other determining factor).  

Ideal age is between 25 and 32.  

Once this age range is met, analyze the player’s potential, finishing, reactions, dribbling, ball control, long shots, volleys, and vision (in that order of priority) when determining the player’s salary.  

These components 	play the most significant roles within the data collected in calculating a player’s value.
